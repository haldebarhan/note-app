# Overview

In this project, I aimed to deepen my understanding of TypeScript and its capabilities by developing a note-taking application. The goal was to create a robust, user-friendly software that allows users to create, edit, and organize their notes efficiently. Through this project, I have explored key features of TypeScript, including classes, asynchronous programming, and exception handling, while also implementing best practices in software development.

The purpose of writing this software is to solidify my grasp of TypeScript as a programming language and to showcase how it can be used to build practical applications. By working on this project, I have gained valuable insights into TypeScript's type system, error handling, and the importance of code organization.

To start the app on your local computer, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
1. Run **npm install** to install the necessary dependencies
1. Run **npm run watch** to build typescript files
1. Run **npm run dev** to run the project

# Development Environment

To develop this software, I used the following tools:

- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code
- **Version Control**: Git for tracking changes and collaboration
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment
- **TypeScript**: Programming language used for building the application
- **Jest**: Testing framework for writing and running unit tests

The application leverages TypeScript's features such as strong typing, interfaces, and classes to ensure code quality and maintainability.

# Useful Websites

Here are some websites that I found particularly helpful during the development of this project:

- [TypeScript Official Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
- [MDN Web Docs - JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [Jest Documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)
- [NodeJs Documentation](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/)
- [Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc)

# Future Work

There are several improvements and features that I plan to implement in the future:

- **User Authentication**: Implement a user login and registration system to allow users to save their notes securely.
- **Rich Text Editing**: Enhance the note editor to support rich text formatting (bold, italics, lists, etc.).
- **Cloud Storage Integration**: Allow users to save their notes to cloud storage for access from multiple devices.
- **Search Functionality**: Implement a search feature to help users find notes quickly.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Optimize the application for mobile devices to improve user experience.
